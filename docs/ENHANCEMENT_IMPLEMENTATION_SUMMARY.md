## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Analytics API Enhancement (`/app/api/analytics/route.ts`)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Basic timestamp handling causing errors
const timestamp = new Date(analyticsData.timestamp);

// AFTER: Robust error handling with fallbacks
let validTimestamp: Date;
try {
  // Multiple validation layers with fallback to current time
  const parsedDate = new Date(analyticsData.timestamp);
  validTimestamp = !isNaN(parsedDate.getTime()) ? parsedDate : new Date();
} catch {
  validTimestamp = new Date();
}
```
